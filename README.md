# Aziz

Inspired from ["5th Element"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116), Aziz is a simple application to control smart lighting. The application installs a notification icon in the system tray to toggle a smart light switch on or off using [Samsung SmartThings](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com).
